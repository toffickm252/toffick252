###  Practice they say makes perfect- Unknown

## Welcome to my Github repository on Using predictive Analysis model to diagnose a breast tumor

### Core Objective:
This is a learning exercise to:
* Apply the numpy and pandas libraries to help in manipulating the data at hand
* Apply various data visualization libraries like seaborn and matplotlib to interpret and draw insights from the data
* Apply the fundamentals of machine learning on the available datset(i used support vector machine)
* Create a notebook that explains my scientific computations and my thought process.

### The analysis is divided into 8 sections in the same jupyter notebook.
* Identifying the problem and data sources
* Data Cleaning
* Feature Engineering
* Exploratory data Analysis
* Data Preprocessing
* Feature selection with recursive feature elimination
* Model Building using Support vector machine
* Validating the model with k-folds
